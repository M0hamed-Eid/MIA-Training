## Introduction

This Arduino code is designed to interface with a rotary encoder and track the number of pulses generated by the A and B signals. It also implements a low-pass filter to smoothen the pulse count. The code can be used for applications where precise counting of encoder pulses is required.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Rotary encoder with A and B signal outputs
- Wiring and connection components

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- USB cable for uploading code to the Arduino board

## Setup

1. Connect the rotary encoder to the Arduino board. Connect the A and B signal outputs of the encoder to the appropriate digital input pins on the Arduino (update `encoderPinA` and `encoderPinB` in the code with the actual pin numbers used).

2. Ensure that the Arduino IDE is installed on your computer.

3. Upload the provided `.ino` code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

## Usage

1. After uploading the code, open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the filtered encoder count.

2. The code can be customized to perform specific actions based on the encoder count, making it suitable for various applications.

## Code Explanation

### Interfacing with Rotary Encoder

- The code utilizes interrupt handlers to detect transitions in the A and B signals of the rotary encoder. These transitions are used to increment or decrement the encoder count.

- The `updateEncoder` function is an interrupt handler responsible for tracking encoder pulses based on the transitions of the A and B signals.

### Low-Pass Filter

- A simple low-pass filter is implemented to smoothen the encoder count.

- The `lowPassFilter` function calculates the filtered value using a first-order low-pass filter formula. The cutoff frequency (`fc`) is a configurable parameter that determines the filter's behavior.
